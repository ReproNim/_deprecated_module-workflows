### Introduction

[Earlier training modules](http://www.repronim.org/teach.html) presented 
concepts and technologies which can be used to improve reproducibility in our 
research.  As it often goes, there is no "the only one" way to compose them
to establish an efficient work flow with reproducibility in mind. In this
module we would like to collect conceptually different possible complete 
workflows which would touch upon all the previously mentioned aspects of 
data management, analysis, sharing and collaboration.  If the workflow you are
using differs conceptually, please contribute a lesson to this module.

### How much time should this take?

That primarily depends on your familiarity and experience with technologies
used in any particular workflow.  The lessons could be used as cursory overview
or detailed "hands on" tutorials, so the time you will need could vary from 
minutes to a few hours.  If you find any specific concept or technology of 
interest for a more detailed training, please follow the links to the 
corresponding lessons, which could also extend amount of time necessary.

### How should the acquired knowledge be used?

It is important to **apply** the knowledge gained from the lessons to
your day-to-day activities as soon as possible!   If complete workflows
do not fit already established procedures at your lab/center, consider 
adopting them partially and gradually.  Note that often an initial time
investment might seem "too much" but in our experience it pays back quickly and 
tenfold.

**The least efficient approach would be to spend a week "learning
it" only to forget all of it by not using any of the learned tools
or recommended practices.**
