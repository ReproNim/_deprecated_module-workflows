Top-down presentations of complete workflows with reproducibility in
mind, which take advantage of tools and concepts introduced in
[earlier "bottom up" training modules](http://www.repronim.org/teach.html).

This module is a part of the training curriculum from
the [ReproNim](http://www.reproducibleimaging.org) (Reproducible Neuroimaging) Center.

The [template](https://github.com/repronim/module-template) for all
ReproNim modules is based on the templates of
[Neurohackweek]({{site.nhw_site }}), [Data Carpentry]({{ site.dc_site }})
and [Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }}) workshops.
